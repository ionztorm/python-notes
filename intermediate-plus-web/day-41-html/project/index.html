    <h1>Movie Rankings</h1>
    <h2>My top 5 movies of all time</h2>
    <hr />
    <h2>The Lord of the Rings</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The Fellowship of the Ring</li>
      <li>The Two Towers</li>
      <li>The Return of the King</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This movie was my introduction to the world of Tolkien. I love all the
      other movies in the franchise, too, but this one stands out as my first
      memory. It also came out at a time when life was good, so brings back good
      memories.
    </p>
    <h2>The Matrix</h2>
    <p>
      The first Matrix movie is one that I got on VHS for christmas in my teens.
      I sat in my room and watched it on repeat all day - yes I spend a lot of
      time rewinding the cassette. The idea behind the world of The Matrix got
      me hooked. I watched this movie so many times that I knew the entire
      script, word for word. Another one that brings back great memories.
    </p>
    <h2>Gladiator</h2>
    <p>
      This is not one that brings back good memories, but I do have a keen
      interest in the Romans and Ancient Greeks. The story is great, telling of
      the fall and rise of a persons life, the plight of ambition over all else,
      and the downfall of power. A classic good vs evil told in a new way.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've also just recently watched the sequel, which I thought was great,
      too.
    </p>
    <h2>Hackers</h2>
    <p>
      I saw this one at the cinema with my then best friend. Not everybody had a
      computer back then, but my dad did and he let me play on it. My use
      involved only playing minesweeper, Myst, and doing my homework - we even
      had one of those nasty belt driven printers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The movie opend my eyes to the possiblities of the internet and computing
      and is the trigger that drove me into becoming a tech nerd.
    </p>
    <p>I still watch this a few times each year.</p>
    <h2>Leon: The Professional</h2>
    <p>
      This one is not in my top 5 because we share the same name; in fact, I
      can't put my finger on why I like this one so much. The story and action
      are great, and the cast is fantastic
    </p>
    <p>Fun fact: the young girl in this movie is Natalie Portman.</p>
    <h2>Honorable Mention</h2>
    <h3>Dune</h3>
    <p>
      The modern Dune fanchise is a masterpiece so far. By the end, the
      collection as a whole could become my 2nd favourite frahchise behind The
      Lord of the Rings, and ahead of The Matrix.
