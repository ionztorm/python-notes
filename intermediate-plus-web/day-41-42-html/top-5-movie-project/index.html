    <h1>Movie Rankings</h1>
    <h2>My top 5 movies of all time</h2>
    <hr />
    <h2>The Tolkien Universe</h2>
    <p>
      I've bundled all these into one entry as otherwise, my top 5 would be
      full.
    </p>
    <p>
      This first movie was my introduction to the world of Tolkien. I love all
      the other movies in the franchise, too, but this one stands out as my
      first memory. It also came out at a time when life was good, so brings
      back good memories.
    </p>
    <h3>The Lord of the Rings</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The Fellowship of the Ring - 2001</li>
      <li>The Two Towers - 2002</li>

        Boyd, Dominic Minaghan, Christopher Lee, Liv Tyler, Orlando Bloom, John
        Rhys-Davies, Sean Bean, Hugo Weaving, and Andy Serkis.</em
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Fun Fact:</strong> The voice of Treebeard was John Rhys-Davies,
      who also played Gimli.
    </p>
    <h3>The Hobbit</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>An Unexpected Journey - 2012</li>
      <li>The Desolation of Smaug - 2013</li>
      <li>The Battle of the Five Armies - 2014</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <em
        >Starring: Martin Freeman, Ian McKellen, Richard Armitage, Benedict
        Cumberbatch, Lee Pace, Evangeline Lilly, Orlando Bloom, Luke Evans, Cate
        Blanchett, Hugo Weaving, Christopher Lee, Ian Holm, and Andy Serkis</em
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Bennedict Cumberbach played both Smaug and
      Sauron.
    </p>
    <h2>The Matrix - 1999</h2>
    <p>
      The first Matrix movie is one that I got on VHS for christmas in my teens.
      I sat in my room and watched it on repeat all day - yes I spend a lot of
      time rewinding the cassette. The idea behind the world of The Matrix got
      me hooked. I watched this movie so many times that I knew the entire
      script, word for word. Another one that brings back great memories.
    </p>
    <h2>Gladiator - 2000</h2>
    <p>
      <em
        >Starring: Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed,
        Richard Harris, Djimon Hounsou, Derek Jacobi, Ralf Möller, and Tommy
        Flanagan</em
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Oliver Reed (who played Proximo) died before
      filming was complete, so some of his scenes were finished using a body
      double and CGI face replacement, which was groundbreaking for its time.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is not one that brings back good memories, but I do have a keen
      interest in the Romans and Ancient Greeks. The story is great, telling of
      the fall and rise of a persons life, the plight of ambition over all else,
      and the downfall of power. A classic good vs evil told in a new way.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've also just recently watched the sequel, which I thought was great,
      too.
    </p>
    <h2>Hackers - 1995</h2>
    <p>
      <em
        >Starring: Jonny Lee Miller, Angelina Jolie, Jesse Bradford, Matthew
        Lillard, Laurence Mason, Renoly Santiago, Fisher Stevens, Alberta
        Watson, and Wendell Pierce.</em
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Fun Fact:</strong>Fun Fact: Angelina Jolie and Jonny Lee Miller
      met on this set and were married for a short time after filming this
      movie.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw this one at the cinema with my then best friend. Not everybody had a
      computer back then, but my dad did and he let me play on it. My use
      involved only playing minesweeper, Myst, and doing my homework - we even
      had one of those nasty belt driven printers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The movie opend my eyes to the possiblities of the internet and computing
      and is the trigger that drove me into becoming a tech nerd.
    </p>
    <p>I still watch this a few times each year.</p>
    <h2>Leon: The Professional - 1994</h2>
    <p>
      <em
        >Starring: Jean Reno, Natalie Portman, Gary Oldman, and Danny
        Aiello.</em
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Gary Oldman improvised the famous "EVERYONE!!!"
      line, making it one of the most iconic and meme-worthy moments in film
      history.
    </p>
    <p>
      This one is not in my top 5 because we share the same name; in fact, I
      can't put my finger on why I like this one so much. The story and action
      are great, and the cast is fantastic
    </p>
    <p>
      Fun fact: the young girl in this movie is Natalie Portman, she was only 11
      at the time.
    </p>
    <h2>Honorable Mention</h2>
    <h3>Dune</h3>
    <p>
      <em
        >Starring: Timothée Chalamet, Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac,
        Josh Brolin, Stellan Skarsgård, Dave Bautista, Javier Bardem, Charlotte
        Rampling, Jason Momoa, Stephen McKinley Henderson, Florence Pugh, Austin
        Butler, Léa Seydoux, and Christopher Walken.</em
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Fun Fact:</strong> TFor Dune: Part Two, Austin Butler (who plays
      Feyd-Rautha) stayed in character even off-set, speaking in his eerie,
      villainous voice and keeping the bleached eyebrows, much like his method
      approach for Elvis (2022).
    </p>
    <p>
      The modern Dune fanchise is a masterpiece so far. By the end, the
      collection as a whole could become my 2nd favourite frahchise behind The
      Lord of the Rings, and ahead of The Matrix.
