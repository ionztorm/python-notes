# Object Oriented Programming - OOP

OOP involves creating a model of real-world entities.

These models, knwn as `classes`, should define what the entity has and what it does.

- We define what it has using `attributes`
- We define what it does using `methods`

A `class` is a blueprint of the entity, and we can create as many instances of these classes as we need.

The instances we create from the classes are known as `objects`.

## Constructing Objects

To create an object from a class we use the following syntax:

```py
object_name = ClassName()
```

## Accessing Attributes

```py
object_name.attribute
```

## Accessing Methods

```py
object_name.method()
```
